    "# Introduction\n",
    "In the news, everyone's got an opinion, and everyone also has an opinion about the news. This channel is biased, that show only talks about negative news, the whole media covers too much Trump. Opinions are easy to make based on the individuals shows and clips we watch or see shared on social media every day. Therefore, now more than ever, it's critical that our understanding of how we produce and consume news is informed by data, not anecdotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, advances in artificial intelligence and big data systems are now enabling us to analyze complex visual mediums like video at scale. Computer vision and machine learning technologies can automatically watch video to find and recognize individuals, identify visual attributes like clothing, lighting, and setting, as well as break video into segments, e.g. commercials vs. news. Cloud infrastructure combined with big data systems can enable small groups to scale these technologies to automatically annotate thousands or millions of hours of video.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we analyzed 70,000 hours of US TV news video provided by the Internet Archive to identify trends in screen time, speaking time, clothing, and more with a focus on gender bias. Our dataset specifically consisted of every video broadcast by CNN, FOX, and MSNBC since January 1, 2015, and included the video, audio, and closed captions. Methodology for each analysis is provided at the end of this report."

    "Most of the news is anchors and guests staring into the camera, discussing the topics of the day with one another (or in monologue). Here, we are interested in understanding who is being provided the platform to share their views, along with when/where that occurs. We computed two metrics: screen time, or the length of time a person is on screen, and speaking time, or how long a person is talking in the audio stream. For example, if two men and one woman are on screen for 5 seconds with the woman speaking, this would be 10 seconds of male screen time, 5 seconds of female screen time, and 5 seconds of female speaking time. We then look at the percentage of total time that anyone was on screen or anyone was talking to determine the fraction of men vs. women."

    "# Topic coverage\n",
    "With the abolition of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 shortly preceding the rise of cable news, it has been a well documented phenomenon that today's news networks are more polarized than ever before. Consuming media from a single network presents a very particular view of the world, but we'd like to quantify the extent to which different networks cover different people, events, and topics. One perspective on this asks, given the same topic like gun control, what viewpoints do the networks have and how do they promote them? This requires a nuanced understanding of the language used, so we instead look at a simpler question: who is covering particular topics, people, and phrases and for how long?"
